# Phase 5.6: Furnace Upgrades

**Part of:** Phase 5 - Own Furnace and Worker Management
**Status:** Planning
**Created:** 2025-11-25 (Split from phase-5-own-furnace.md)
**Dependencies:** Phase 5.1 (Core Systems)

### Integration with Existing Systems

#### Charisma Stat Integration

Update Global.gd experience system documentation:

**Charisma Benefits (Hidden from Player):**
- **Fatigue Reduction:** -2% per level (max -40% at level 20)
- **Morale Bonus:** +0.4 morale per level (max +12 at charisma 30)
- **Reputation Bonus:** +1 reputation per level (max +30)
- **Recovery Speed:** +0.02/sec per 5 levels
- **Hiring Pool:** High charisma attracts better quality candidates

#### Overseer Management Style Integration

Update Hired Overseer System section:

**Management Style Effects** (add fatigue column):

| Slider % | Label | Cost | Production | Charisma Gain | **Fatigue Rate** |
|----------|-------|------|------------|---------------|------------------|
| 0% | Comfortable | -20% | 0.5x | 0.2 | 0.5x |
| 10% | Considerate | -16% | 0.6x | 0.5 | 0.6x |
| 20% | Lenient | -12% | 0.7x | 0.8 | 0.7x |
| 30% | **Orderly** | -8% | **0.8x** | **1.0** | **0.85x** |
| 40% | Fair | -5% | 0.9x | 0.8 | 1.0x |
| 50% | Firm | 0% | 1.0x | 0.5 | 1.15x |
| 60% | Strict | -3% | 1.1x | 0.3 | 1.3x |
| 70% | Demanding | -5% | 1.2x | 0.15 | 1.5x |
| 80% | Harsh | -7% | 1.3x | 0.05 | 1.7x |
| 90% | **Severe** | -9% | **1.35x** | **0.01** | **1.9x** |
| 100% | Ruthless | -10% | 1.4x | 0.0 | 2.1x |

**Note:** Management style affects worker fatigue accumulation both online (player present) and offline (hired overseer managing).

#### Revenue Formula Integration

Update revenue calculation in owned_furnace.tscn:

```gdscript
# Revenue calculation with worker productivity
var base_revenue = 0.1  # coins per second
var performance_multiplier = revenue_multipliers[performance]  # excellent/good/poor/failing
var worker_productivity = calculate_average_worker_productivity()
var morale_modifier = get_morale_productivity(crew_morale)

var final_revenue = base_revenue * performance_multiplier *
                    worker_productivity * morale_modifier
```

Where `calculate_average_worker_productivity()` returns average of all active workers' fatigue-based performance multipliers.

```

**Button Functions:**

**Diversion Slider:**
- Range: 0% to 100%
- Default: 0% (no active diversion)
- Saves to Level1Vars.storage_diversion_percentage
- Continuously diverts X% of steam production to storage (before demand consumption)
- Works independently of overflow (overflow still captures excess when main is full)
- Strategic use: Set to 20-50% during low demand/low pay periods to build reserves
- Real-time preview: "Diverting ~15 steam/sec to storage at current production"
- Color indicator: Green when diverting, gray when at 0%

**Release 10% Button:**
- Releases 10% of max storage capacity (not current stored amount)
- Example: With 1,200 max storage, always releases 120 steam per click
- Consistent release amount regardless of how much is currently stored
- Can be clicked multiple times rapidly for larger releases
- Button disabled if stored_steam == 0
- Shows actual amount being released: "Release 10% (120 steam)"
- Provides fine-grained, predictable control

**Auto-Release Toggle:**
- Checkbox to enable/disable
- Saves state to Level1Vars.auto_release_enabled
- When enabled, shows threshold slider

**Threshold Slider:**
- Range: 0% to 100%
- Default: 60%
- Saves to Level1Vars.auto_release_threshold
- Real-time preview: "Will release when below 300/500 steam"

**Behavior:**
- Auto-release only triggers during "high" or "critical" demand states
- Releases 100% of stored steam when triggered
- Shows notification: "Auto-release activated!"
- Useful for semi-idle gameplay

#### 6. Educational Flavor Text & Historical Context

When players purchase material upgrades, show brief historical/educational popups:

**Cast Iron Shell Unlock:**
> "Cast iron furnaces dominated early industry, but brittleness limited their use to moderate temperatures. The Darby family revolutionized ironmaking in 1709 with coke-fired furnaces, but the material itself remained the limiting factor."

**Wrought Iron Shell Unlock:**
> "Wrought iron's fibrous structure and lower carbon content made it more ductile and resistant to thermal stress. By the mid-1800s, it was the preferred material for steam locomotive fireboxes and pressure vessels."

**Mild Steel Shell Unlock:**
> "The Bessemer process (1856) and later the open-hearth furnace made steel affordable and consistent. Steel combined the best properties of cast and wrought iron, enabling the Industrial Revolution's greatest achievements."

**Cupola Furnace Unlock:**
> "The cupola furnace has been melting cast iron since the 1700s. Its tall cylindrical design creates a continuous process—coke, limestone, and iron are charged at the top while molten metal pours from the bottom. Your furnace can now reach 1,550°C."

**Blast Furnace Unlock:**
> "Blast furnaces use forced air ('blast') to reach extreme temperatures for smelting iron ore. The tall structure creates counter-current heat exchange, with rising hot gases preheating descending raw materials. Modern blast furnaces produce hundreds of tons of iron per day."

**Induction Furnace Unlock:**
> "Electromagnetic induction heats metal without direct contact, discovered by Michael Faraday in 1831 but not industrialized until the 1900s. Clean, precise, and efficient—perfect for high-grade steel production. Your furnace now operates at 1,800°C."

**Electric Arc Furnace Unlock:**
> "Electric arc furnaces use electrode arcs hot enough to vaporize tungsten (3,422°C). First developed by Paul Héroult in 1900, they now produce most of the world's steel. Arc plasma reaches 3,000-5,000°C—the temperature of the sun's surface."

**Firebrick Lining Unlock:**
> "Firebrick, or refractory brick, has protected furnace walls since ancient times. Made from alumina-silica clay, it insulates and protects metal shells from direct flame contact, enabling higher operating temperatures."

**High-Alumina Lining Unlock:**
> "High-alumina refractories (50-90% Al₂O₃) were developed in the early 1900s for the growing steel industry. Excellent thermal shock resistance and a melting point above 1,750°C made them indispensable for modern metallurgy."

**Magnesia Lining Unlock:**
> "Magnesium oxide (MgO) refractories are 'super refractories' with melting points exceeding 2,800°C. Used in modern steel furnaces and cement kilns, they resist basic slags and extreme temperatures that would destroy other materials."

**Silicon Carbide Lining Unlock:**
> "Silicon carbide (SiC), discovered by Edward Acheson in 1891, is nearly as hard as diamond and conducts heat better than copper. In reducing atmospheres, it can withstand extreme thermal stress. However, it oxidizes rapidly above 1,650°C in air—handle with care."

**Gameplay Integration:**
- Show these messages as popup notifications on first purchase
- Store in a "Furnace Encyclopedia" accessible from UI
- Optional: Quiz system (similar to overseer talks) where answering metallurgy questions gives bonuses
- Achievement system: "Metallurgist" for collecting all furnace types, "Alchemist" for reaching 3,000°C
