# Evening Phase Brainstorm

**Goal**: Design the evening half of the day/night cycle that complements active day gameplay with passive/idle mechanics

**Purpose of This Document**: Brainstorming session for evening phase ideas. Relaunch this plan to continue generating and refining concepts. This is an idea capture document, not an implementation plan.

**Success Criteria**: A cohesive evening phase that:
- Provides meaningful passive income progression
- Creates synergy with day phase (each strengthens the other)
- Uses a thematic underworld currency
- Offers multiple idle activity options across different scenes

---

## Core Design Tension

**Day Phase (Active Play)**:
- Shovel coal in the furnace
- Earn copper pieces (official currency)
- Poor pay from overlords
- Goal: 1000 copper -> 1 silver piece -> beat level

**Evening Phase (Passive/Idle Play)**:
- Explore panel scenes
- Set idle mechanics in motion
- Earn underworld currency
- Goal: Progress toward 1000 copper through indirect means

**Synergy Requirement**: Progress in one phase should strengthen the other. Neglecting either side should feel like leaving value on the table.

---

## Underworld Currency Ideas

The currency should feel:
- Grimdark and thematic (not whimsical)
- Something the poor/oppressed would use between themselves
- Clearly distinct from the official copper/silver system
- Low-value individually but meaningful in aggregate

### Currency: Weeps (SELECTED)

**Full Name**: Lethe Weep Knots
**Slang**: Weeps

**What They Are**:
- Rope segments soaked in "Lethe weep" - a substance that drips from the train's undercarriage
- The liquid stains rope a deep void-black with occasional flecks of silver, like a night sky
- Looking at it too long feels... wrong
- Ties into the game's existing Lethe/forgetting theme (forgetting chemicals in rations)

**Why They Have Value**:
- Can only be made from rope exposed to the Lethe weep drip points in the Frayed End
- The substance is scarce - only certain spots under the train produce it
- Can't be faked - the void-black color and silver flecks are distinctive
- Worthless to overlords (they don't go under the train, don't know it exists)

**Thematic Resonance**:
- "The train weeps and we collect its tears"
- Currency born from something the rulers ignore
- Slightly unsettling quality fits grimdark tone
- Memory/forgetting theme woven through the economy

**Exchange Rate Concept**:
- TBD weeps = 1 copper (terrible rate)
- Earning weeps is passive (evening) vs active (day copper)
- Player chooses: grind actively, or set up passive income and wait

## Evening Scene Ideas

The player needs places to go and things to do. Each scene should:
- Have a distinct idle mechanic to set in motion
- Produce cinders (or equivalent) over time
- Have some form of skill/upgrade progression
- Feel thematically appropriate to the underworld/worker setting

### Scene 1: The Dim Lantern (Tavern/Gambling)

**Core Mechanic**: Gambling with other workers
- Bet cinders on games of chance
- Different games = different risk/reward profiles
- Could win big, could lose everything

**Idle Aspect**:
- "Run a game" option: be the house, take a cut
- Set it and leave, collect earnings next evening
- Risk of getting robbed or game broken up

**Synergy with Day**:
- Charisma affects gambling outcomes?
- Dexterity helps with sleight of hand?
- Intelligence helps count cards/odds?

**Upgrades**:
- Better tables = higher stakes
- Reputation = more players = more action
- Muscle = protection from theft

---

### Scene 2: The Black Market (Odd Jobs Board)

**Core Mechanic**: Pick up jobs that run passively
- Small tasks that take time but not attention
- "Carry this message" - runs while you play day phase
- "Watch this corner" - passive observation job

**Idle Aspect**:
- Select a job, it completes over real time or day cycles
- Collect payment next evening
- Some jobs have risk (suspicion gain, chance of failure)

**Synergy with Day**:
- Strength jobs: hauling, muscle work
- Dexterity jobs: pickpocketing, sleight of hand
- Wisdom jobs: information gathering
- Stats affect success rates and payouts

**Upgrades**:
- Reputation unlocks better jobs
- Connections = exclusive contracts
- Tools = job efficiency

---

### Scene 3: The Scrap Heap (Scavenging)

**Core Mechanic**: Pick through industrial refuse
- Search for valuable scraps
- Find components, nails, cinders, occasionally copper

**Idle Aspect**:
- Hire urchins to scavenge for you
- They work while you do other things
- Take a cut but provide passive income

**Synergy with Day**:
- Wisdom helps identify valuable items
- Constitution helps endure the stench/conditions
- Dexterity helps with quick grabs before guards notice

**Upgrades**:
- Better scavengers (more reliable, less theft)
- Territory expansion (access to better heaps)
- Tools (magnets, sieves, etc.)

---

### Scene 4: The Whisper Network (Information Trading)

**Core Mechanic**: Trade secrets and rumors
- Information has value in a surveillance state
- Buy low, sell high on gossip
- Some info helps with day phase (overseer moods, inspection times)

**Idle Aspect**:
- Plant listeners in locations
- They gather intel while you're away
- Sell valuable information to others

**Synergy with Day**:
- Intel about overseer = better timing for actions
- Knowledge of inspection schedules = safer stealing
- Charisma affects what you can extract from contacts

**Upgrades**:
- More listeners = more coverage
- Better contacts = higher value intel
- Code systems = harder to intercept

---

### Scene 5: The Barter Circle (Trading)

**Core Mechanic**: Exchange goods between workers
- Not just currency trading, but items
- Find deals, buy low sell high
- Market fluctuates based on... something?

**Idle Aspect**:
- Set standing buy/sell orders
- Auto-trade when conditions are met
- Collect profits next visit

**Synergy with Day**:
- Excess coal/materials from day can be sold
- Buy stamina potions/buffs for day phase
- Intelligence helps spot good deals

**Upgrades**:
- Market access (more traders)
- Storage space (hold more inventory)
- Reputation (better prices)

---

## Synergy Mechanics

### Day -> Evening Benefits

Progress in day phase should unlock/improve evening options:

1. **Coal Spillage Collection**
   - During furnace work, some cinders accumulate
   - More shoveling = more spillage = more evening currency to gamble/trade

2. **Stat Improvements**
   - Higher stats from day phase grind improve evening outcomes
   - Charisma = better gambling/trading
   - Wisdom = better scavenging/intel
   - etc.

3. **Copper Investment**
   - Can spend some copper to "invest" in evening operations
   - Buy better equipment for scavengers
   - Stake money for gambling house
   - Bribe for better job access

4. **Reputation from Production**
   - Good worker by day = trusted by night
   - Overlords don't suspect a hard worker
   - Access to more sensitive information networks

### Evening -> Day Benefits

Progress in evening phase should help day phase:

1. **Cinder -> Copper Exchange**
   - Direct conversion (bad rate but passive income)
   - Contributes to 1000 copper goal without active grinding

2. **Black Market Supplies**
   - Buy stamina potions
   - Get better shovels (unofficial, off the books)
   - Acquire equipment that helps day work

3. **Intelligence Benefits**
   - Know when overseer is in bad mood (avoid converting)
   - Know inspection schedules (safer stealing)
   - Know which coal bins are being watched

4. **Social Capital**
   - Favors owed = help when caught?
   - Connections = someone covers for you
   - Reduce suspicion through network

## Idle Mechanic Design Principles

Based on [game-design-principles.md](../../docs/game-design-principles.md) Idle/Incremental section:

1. **Simple Core, Complex Meta**
   - Each scene has one main action to set up
   - Complexity comes from choosing where to invest

2. **Visible Progress Tracking**
   - Show passive income rate (cinders/hour or /cycle)
   - Track what's accumulating while away

3. **Offline/Away Progression**
   - Cap accumulation to prevent exploits (max 8 hours?)
   - Present accumulated rewards prominently on return

4. **Prestige/Reset Consideration**
   - Evening investments could persist through prestige?
   - Or reset with bonus based on evening infrastructure built?

---

## Open Questions

- [ ] How long is an "evening"? Real time? Game cycles?
- [ ] Can player stay in evening indefinitely or is there a timer?
- [ ] How does transition between day/evening work? Time of day? Player choice?
- [ ] Should evening scenes share a hub or be separate locations?
- [ ] What happens to evening activities when day starts?
- [ ] How many evening cycles until idle investments pay back their cost?
- [ ] Should there be evening-only events/random encounters?
- [ ] How does this interact with the existing shop/atm systems?

---

## Next Steps

1. Pick a currency (cinders recommended)
2. Design 2-3 evening scenes in detail
3. Define the day/evening transition mechanic
4. Prototype one idle activity
5. Playtest synergy loops

## Session Notes

### Session 1 (2026-01-08)

**Initial Concepts from User**:
- Evening is characterized by exploring panel scenes and setting idle mechanics
- Player should be able to progress through 1000 copper goal actively, passively, or both
- Each style of play should strengthen the other
- Underworld currency with bad exchange rate to official currency
- Gambling mentioned as one potential activity
- Odd jobs as another potential activity

**Claude's Additions**:
- Recommended "Cinders" as underworld currency (thematic tie to furnace)
- Five scene concepts: Tavern, Black Market, Scrap Heap, Whisper Network, Barter Circle
- Detailed synergy mechanics between phases
- Questions about timing and transitions

**User Feedback**:
- Game is set on a city-sized train
- "Frayed End" is a shantytown suspended on ropes/nets under the train's undercarriage, between the wheels - very poor, potential evening exploration space
- "Cinders" rejected: implies still burning, hard to carry
- Need new currency name that works better

**Idle Activity Categories** (User-defined):
1. **Active Tasks**: Protagonist or hired helper must spend time on this
   - Each character can only do 1 active task at a time
   - Cannot do while working day shift or sleeping
   - Can continue for limited time when player logs off

2. **Passive Tasks**: Initiated and runs on its own
   - Continues during day shift, sleep, or logged off
   - No character time commitment after setup

## To Continue Brainstorming

Reopen this plan and add to Session Notes with new ideas. Focus areas:
- Flesh out specific idle mechanics
- Design UI mockups for evening scenes
- Define progression curves for evening investments
- Work out the math on passive vs active income rates
