# Physics Objects Setup (Shovelling Phase 1)

**Goal**: Create the physical environment for shovelling gameplay - coal pile, furnace opening with obstacles, and shovel surface.

**Success Criteria**:
- Coal pile visual and scoop detection area rendered in bottom-left
- Furnace opening with physical obstacles rendered on right side
- Shovel follows mouse as RigidBody2D with collision surface and tilt physics
- Left/Right click controls shovel tilt (balancing mechanic)
- Shared PhysicsMaterial resources created and applied
- All elements visible and positioned correctly

## Overview

This phase establishes the static physical environment for the shovelling mechanic. No coal spawning or tracking yet - just the physical objects that coal will interact with. The shovel follows the mouse with physics-based rotation that can be controlled via left/right click for balancing. The furnace has collision obstacles but no delivery detection.

**Dependencies**:
- Requires [2.x-scene-network.md](2.x-scene-network.md) for scene structure
- Modifies existing `level1/furnace.tscn` and `level1/furnace.gd`

## Implementation Tasks

### 1. Shared PhysicsMaterial Resources

Create reusable physics materials to avoid redundant instantiation.

**Files to create:**
- `res://level1/coal_physics_material.tres`
- `res://level1/shovel_physics_material.tres`

**coal_physics_material.tres:**
```
[gd_resource type="PhysicsMaterial" format=3]

[resource]
friction = 0.7
bounce = 0.15
```

**shovel_physics_material.tres:**
```
[gd_resource type="PhysicsMaterial" format=3]

[resource]
friction = 0.7
bounce = 0.1
```

### 2. Coal Pile Visual and Detection Area

Position a coal pile in the bottom-left of the playarea with an Area2D for scoop detection.

**In furnace.tscn:**
- Add Node2D named "CoalPile" under playarea
- Add Polygon2D child for visual (filled black/dark gray polygon)
- Add Area2D child named "CoalPileArea"
- Add CircleShape2D to Area2D (radius: 100px)

**In furnace.gd:**
```gdscript
@onready var coal_pile_area: Area2D = $AspectContainer/MainContainer/mainarea/PlayArea/CoalPile/CoalPileArea
@onready var playarea: Control = $AspectContainer/MainContainer/mainarea/PlayArea

var coal_pile_position: Vector2
var coal_pile_radius: float = 100.0

func _ready():
    ResponsiveLayout.apply_to_scene(self)  # REQUIRED
    connect_navigation()
    # Defer physics setup until after layout is applied
    await get_tree().process_frame
    setup_physics_objects()

func setup_physics_objects():
    # Get playarea size
    var playarea_size = playarea.size

    # Calculate coal pile position (bottom-left corner)
    coal_pile_position = Vector2(100, playarea_size.y - 100)

    # Position coal pile
    $AspectContainer/MainContainer/mainarea/PlayArea/CoalPile.position = coal_pile_position
```

**Visual design:**
- Shape: Irregular polygon resembling a mound
- Color: Dark gray or black (#2a2a2a)
- Size: ~100px radius
- Position: Bottom-left, approximately (100, viewport_height - 100)

### 3. Furnace Opening with Physical Obstacles

Create vertical line on right side with physical obstacles above/below the opening.

**In furnace.tscn:**
- Add Node2D named "FurnaceWall" under playarea
- Add Line2D child named "TopLine" for visual line (top segment)
- Add Line2D child named "BottomLine" for visual line (bottom segment)
- Add StaticBody2D named "TopObstacle"
- Add CollisionShape2D with RectangleShape2D (40px thick)
- Add StaticBody2D named "BottomObstacle"
- Add CollisionShape2D with RectangleShape2D (40px thick)

**In furnace.gd:**
```gdscript
@onready var furnace_wall: Node2D = $AspectContainer/MainContainer/mainarea/PlayArea/FurnaceWall

var furnace_line_x: float
var furnace_opening_top: float
var furnace_opening_bottom: float
var furnace_opening_height_percent: float = 0.20  # 20% of playarea height

func setup_physics_objects():
    # ... (previous coal pile setup)

    # Calculate furnace positions
    var furnace_opening_height = playarea_size.y * furnace_opening_height_percent
    furnace_line_x = playarea_size.x - 50
    furnace_opening_top = (playarea_size.y / 2) - (furnace_opening_height / 2)
    furnace_opening_bottom = furnace_opening_top + furnace_opening_height

    # Position furnace wall
    furnace_wall.position.x = furnace_line_x

    # Setup vertical line visual with gap (draw top and bottom segments)
    var top_line = furnace_wall.get_node("TopLine")
    top_line.points = PackedVector2Array([
        Vector2(0, 0),
        Vector2(0, furnace_opening_top)
    ])
    top_line.default_color = Color.BLACK
    top_line.width = 5.0

    var bottom_line = furnace_wall.get_node("BottomLine")
    bottom_line.points = PackedVector2Array([
        Vector2(0, furnace_opening_bottom),
        Vector2(0, playarea_size.y)
    ])
    bottom_line.default_color = Color.BLACK
    bottom_line.width = 5.0

    # Position top obstacle
    var top_obstacle = furnace_wall.get_node("TopObstacle/CollisionShape2D")
    var top_height = furnace_opening_top
    top_obstacle.position = Vector2(0, top_height / 2)
    top_obstacle.shape.size = Vector2(40, top_height)

    # Position bottom obstacle
    var bottom_obstacle = furnace_wall.get_node("BottomObstacle/CollisionShape2D")
    var bottom_height = playarea_size.y - furnace_opening_bottom
    bottom_obstacle.position = Vector2(0, furnace_opening_bottom + (bottom_height / 2))
    bottom_obstacle.shape.size = Vector2(40, bottom_height)
```

**Design values:**
- Furnace line X: playarea_width - 50px
- Opening height: 20% of playarea height (percentage-based for scaling)
- Opening center: playarea_height / 2
- Obstacle thickness: 40px (prevents tunneling)

    line_2d.default_color = Color.BLACK
    line_2d.width = 6.0
    line_2d.z_index = 1

    # Apply shared physics material

    # Initialize position
    global_position = get_global_mouse_position()

func _physics_process(delta):

    var mouse_pos = get_global_mouse_position()

    if playarea:

        drift_direction = 1.0 if randf() > 0.5 else -1.0

    apply_torque(drift_direction * DRIFT_STRENGTH * delta * 60.0)

    # Limit max tilt
    var rot_deg = rad_to_deg(rotation)
    if abs(rot_deg) > MAX_TILT:
        rotation = deg_to_rad(sign(rot_deg) * MAX_TILT)
        angular_velocity *= -0.3  # Bounce back slightly

    # Update cooldown timer (for future use)
    if scoop_cooldown_timer > 0.0:
        scoop_cooldown_timer -= delta

func _input(event):

## Notes

**Why RigidBody2D for shovel?**
- Allows physics-based rotation while position follows mouse
- Friction with coal RigidBody2D works properly (AnimatableBody2D friction is unreliable)
- Enables natural tilting mechanic with torque and angular damping
- High mass (50.0) prevents coal from pushing it around
- Position is directly set each frame, but rotation is physics-based

**Why simple rectangle collision?**
- Easier to debug and tune
- Performance is better
- Coal behavior feels natural with friction/damping regardless of exact curve matching
- Visual curve is purely aesthetic

**Why tilting mechanic?**
- Creates skill-based gameplay - balancing coal while moving
- Physics-based rotation feels natural and emergent
- Random drift adds challenge and prevents static gameplay
- Coal naturally slides toward lower side due to gravity + rotation
- Left/Right click provides simple, intuitive control

**Tuning values:**
- TILT_TORQUE (50000): Strength of click tilt - lower = gentler, higher = more responsive
- DRIFT_STRENGTH (500): Random drift intensity - lower = easier, higher = more challenging
- angular_damp (2.0): How fast rotation slows - lower = floatier, higher = more responsive
- MAX_TILT (45 degrees): Maximum rotation angle - prevents extreme tilting

**Why 40px obstacle thickness?**
- Max expected velocity: 2000 px/sec
- Physics tick: 60Hz (16.67ms)
- Max distance per frame: 2000 / 60 = 33.33px
- Add 20% margin: 33.33 * 1.2 = 40px
- Prevents tunneling (coal phasing through obstacles)

**Why await get_tree().process_frame before setup?**
- ResponsiveLayout.apply_to_scene() needs one frame to calculate PlayArea size
- Without await, playarea.size returns zero, causing objects to be positioned incorrectly
- Deferring setup ensures all layout calculations are complete

**Why percentage-based furnace opening?**
- Absolute pixel values (200px) don't scale properly across resolutions
- Using 20% of playarea height ensures consistent proportions
- Gap remains appropriately sized on all screen sizes

**Why constrain shovel to playarea?**
- Prevents shovel from moving into menu/UI areas
- Keeps gameplay contained within the designated play space
- Uses get_global_rect() and clamp() for smooth boundary enforcement

**Why z_index 0 and 1 instead of -1 and 0?**
- Negative z_index values don't layer correctly in this context
- Using z_index 0 for outline and z_index 1 for main line ensures proper ordering
- Higher z_index draws on top, so black line (z_index 1) appears over gray outline (z_index 0)

**Why 80% gray instead of white/darker grays?**
- White outline was too visually striking and distracting
- 20% gray was too dark and didn't provide enough contrast
- 80% gray (Color(0.8, 0.8, 0.8)) provides clear visibility against black background
- Light gray creates good contrast without being overwhelming

**Next Phase**: Phase 2.2.2 will create coal pieces and implement the scooping mechanism.
