# [SUPERSEDED] Apply Upgrade

**This plan has been merged into [2.x-upgrade-pool.md](2.x-upgrade-pool.md).**

The upgrade pool definition and effect application are now combined in a single plan to eliminate redundancy and clarify implementation order.

See [2.x-upgrade-pool.md](2.x-upgrade-pool.md) for the complete upgrade system implementation.
