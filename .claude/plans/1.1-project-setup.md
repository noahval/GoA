# Project Setup

**Goal**: Create Godot 4.5 project with Forward+ renderer and 1280x720 base resolution

**Success Criteria**:
- Godot 4.5 project created and launches
- Forward+ renderer configured
- 1280x720 (16:9) resolution set
- Export presets configured for Windows, Linux, macOS, and Web (WebGPU)
- Project ready for architecture setup (Phase 1.2)

**Prerequisites**: None (foundational setup)

## Overview

Establishes the foundational Godot 4.5 project for GoA's clean rebuild. This phase focuses solely on project creation and basic configuration - NO game logic, UI theming, or responsive layout (those are separate phases).

### Key Design Decisions

- **Renderer**: Forward+ (desktop/browser optimized, WebGPU for web)
- **Base Resolution**: 1280x720 (16:9 aspect ratio, HD ready)
- **Platform Target**: Desktop and web browser
- **Clean Rebuild**: Starting from scratch, no legacy code migration

**Rationale for 1280x720**:
- Standard 16:9 aspect ratio (universally compatible)
- HD ready resolution (720p)
- Comfortable browser window size
- Scales cleanly to 1920x1080 (150%), 2560x1440 (200%), 3840x2160 (300%)
- Smaller base makes it easier to scale up than down

## Implementation Tasks

### 1. Create New Godot 4.5 Project

**Steps:**
1. Launch Godot 4.5
2. Create New Project
3. Set project name: `GoA`
4. Set project path: `C:\Goa\` (or appropriate location)
5. Select Renderer: **Forward+**
6. Confirm project creation

**Result**: Empty Godot 4.5 project with Forward+ renderer

### 2. Configure project.godot

Open [project.godot](../project.godot) and configure core settings:

**Application Settings:**
```ini
[application]

config/name="GoA"
run/main_scene="res://level1/loading_screen.tscn"  # Will create in later phase
config/features=PackedStringArray("4.5", "Forward Plus")
boot_splash/bg_color=Color(0, 0, 0, 1)
boot_splash/minimum_display_time=1000
```

**Display Settings:**
```ini
[display]

window/size/viewport_width=1280
window/size/viewport_height=720
window/size/mode=2  # Windowed resizable
window/size/resizable=true
window/stretch/mode="canvas_items"
window/stretch/aspect="keep"  # Maintain 16:9 aspect ratio when scaling
```

**Rendering Settings:**
```ini
[rendering]

renderer/rendering_method="forward_plus"
renderer/rendering_method.mobile="gl_compatibility"  # Fallback (unused for now)
```

**Note on Autoloads**: Will be added in Phase 1.2 (Project Architecture)

### 3. Create Basic Folder Structure

Create initial folder organization:

```
GoA/
├── project.godot
├── level1/              # Level 1 specific content (created now, populated later)
└── .claude/             # Already exists with docs, plans, etc.
```

**Command:**
```bash
mkdir level1
```

**Note**: Additional folders (scenes/, autoloads/, etc.) will be created in later phases as needed.

### 4. Configure Export Presets

Set up export templates for target platforms:

**Windows Export Preset:**
- Platform: Windows Desktop
- Architecture: x86_64
- Runnable: Yes
- Export Path: `build/windows/GoA.exe`

**Linux Export Preset:**
- Platform: Linux/BSD
- Architecture: x86_64
- Runnable: Yes (if on Linux)
- Export Path: `build/linux/GoA.x86_64`

**macOS Export Preset:**
- Platform: macOS
- Architecture: Universal (Intel + Apple Silicon)
- Export Path: `build/macos/GoA.app`

**Web Export Preset (WebGPU):**
- Platform: Web
- Export Type: WebAssembly
- Renderer: WebGPU (Forward+ equivalent)
- Canvas Resize Policy: Adaptive
- Export Path: `build/web/index.html`
- Note: Requires Chrome/Edge browser (WebGPU support)

**How to Configure:**
1. Project → Export
2. Add preset for each platform
3. Set export paths as above
4. Download export templates if prompted
5. Save presets

## Testing Strategy

### Manual Test Criteria

**Project Launch:**
- [ ] Project opens in Godot 4.5 editor without errors
- [ ] Forward+ renderer confirmed in Project Settings
- [ ] Resolution shows 1280x720 in Display settings

**Window Behavior:**
- [ ] Test scene runs at 1280x720 windowed mode
- [ ] Window can be resized
- [ ] Aspect ratio maintained (16:9) when resized
- [ ] Fullscreen toggle works (F11)

**Export Tests:**
- [ ] Windows export builds successfully
- [ ] Windows .exe launches and displays correctly
- [ ] Web export builds successfully
- [ ] Web build loads in Chrome/Edge (WebGPU enabled)
- [ ] Linux export builds (if on Linux)
- [ ] macOS export builds (if on macOS)

**Verification:**
- [ ] No console errors on editor launch
- [ ] No console errors on game launch
- [ ] Project folder structure correct
- [ ] project.godot contains all configured settings

---

## Files to Create

- `project.godot` - Main project configuration file (created by Godot)
- `level1/` - Empty folder for level 1 content

## Files to Modify

None (clean project creation)

## Design Values (Reference)

### Resolution Strategy

- **Base Resolution**: 1280x720 (16:9 aspect ratio, 720p HD)
- **Scaling Targets**:
  - 100%: 1280x720 (base)
  - 150%: 1920x1080 (Full HD)
  - 200%: 2560x1440 (2K)
  - 300%: 3840x2160 (4K)
- **Aspect Ratio**: 16:9 (maintained via "keep" stretch aspect)

### Renderer Capabilities (Forward+)

**Available Features** (for future use):
- Global Illumination (GI)
- Screen-Space Directional Occlusion (SSDO)
- Real-time reflections
- Volumetric fog
- Advanced post-processing effects

**Performance Baseline**:
- Target: 60 FPS on mid-range desktop (GTX 1050 Ti / RX 570)
- Web: 60 FPS in Chrome/Edge with modern GPU

---

## Notes & Decisions

**Decision 1**: Forward+ renderer instead of GL Compatibility
- **Rationale**: Desktop/browser-first design benefits from modern rendering, better performance
- **Trade-off**: Requires WebGPU for web (Chrome/Edge only currently), but acceptable for target audience

**Decision 2**: 1280x720 base resolution (16:9)
- **Rationale**: Standard HD resolution, scales cleanly to higher resolutions, comfortable browser window size
- **Design principle**: Easier to scale up than down

**Decision 3**: Clean rebuild approach
- **Rationale**: No legacy code constraints, can implement best practices from start
- **Benefit**: No technical debt

**Decision 4**: Minimal folder structure initially
- **Rationale**: Create folders as needed in later phases, avoid empty unused directories
- **Approach**: Incremental organization

---
