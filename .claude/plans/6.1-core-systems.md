# Phase 5.1: Core Systems

**Part of:** Phase 5 - Own Furnace and Worker Management
**Status:** Planning
**Created:** 2025-11-25 (Split from phase-5-own-furnace.md)
**Dependencies:** Phases 1-4 (basic furnace mechanics, shop system, stats)

**Currency System Note:** All costs in this document use the multi-currency system:
- 1 Silver = 1000 Copper
- 1 Gold = 1000 Silver
- 1 Platinum = 1000 Gold

Phase 5 begins at ~20 hours of gameplay, when players spend 1 gold to buy their own furnace.

## Overview

Phase 5 represents a major shift in gameplay from being a worker in the Blackbore Furnace to becoming the owner and manager of your own furnace operation. This transition eliminates the overseer-based coin conversion system and introduces a new economy based on steam production, train operations, and meeting fluctuating demand.

### Core Gameplay Loop
1. **Generate Heat** - Shovel coal manually or via workers
2. **Produce Steam** - Heat converts to steam over time
3. **Meet Demand** - Steam demand fluctuates based on train conditions
4. **Earn Revenue** - Get paid based on how well you meet demand
5. **Manage Workers** - Hire and upgrade workers to optimize production

## Key Design Principles

- **Charisma as obscure stat** - No explicit UI, but affects worker efficiency subtly
- **Leadership over labor** - Player manages and leads rather than shovels
- **No visual assets needed** (text-based UI following existing patterns)
- **New scene creation** - owned_furnace.tscn replaces furnace.tscn after purchase
- **Dynamic demand system** - Creates pressure and opportunity
- **Progressive worker management** - Starts simple, scales in complexity

---

## New Metrics & Systems

### 1. Furnace Heat

**Purpose:** Intermediate resource between coal shoveling and steam production

**Properties:**
- Type: Float, can accumulate
- Generation sources:
  - Manual shoveling: +1 heat per shovel (affected by strength bonuses)
  - Workers: Generate heat automatically based on worker level/count
  - Coal burning: Could implement coal auto-consumption for bonus heat
- Decay: Heat slowly dissipates over time (requires constant shoveling/workers)
- Display: Visual meter showing current heat level

**Formula:**
```gdscript
heat_per_shovel = 1.0
heat_decay_rate = 0.5  # per second
current_heat = clamp(current_heat - (heat_decay_rate * delta), 0, max_heat)
```

**Max Heat (Based on Real Materials):**
Max heat is determined by furnace construction material, wall thickness, and refractory lining:
```gdscript
max_heat = base_temp_limit * thickness_multiplier * lining_multiplier
```

See "Furnace Material & Construction System" section below for detailed progression.

### 2. Steam Production

**Purpose:** Primary output resource that fulfills demand, measured in pounds per hour (lb/h)

**Properties:**
- Type: Float, measured in lb/h (pounds per hour)
- Production rate: Based on current heat level
- **No initial storage** - steam converts directly to gold payment
- Storage: Purchasable upgrade (unlocks about 3H into own furnace phase, starts at 5 gold)
- Display: Production rate gauge in lb/h

**Formula:**
```gdscript
# Steam production in pounds per hour (lb/h)
steam_production_rate_lbh = (current_heat / 10.0) * steam_efficiency
steam_efficiency = 1.0 + (furnace_upgrade_lvl * 0.2)

# Starting production: 10 lb/h
base_production = 10.0  # lb/h at base heat and efficiency

# Storage only available after purchase
has_storage_system = false  # Initially no storage
max_storage_lbs = 0.0  # Set when storage purchased (e.g., 500 lb for Tier 1)
```

### 3. Steam Demand (Dynamic System) ⭐

**Purpose:** Creates dynamic gameplay with fluctuating requirements, measured in decimals of gold coin per lb/h

**Demand States:**
- **Very Low Demand**: Range 0.0x - 0.45x (avg ~0.225x) - Train idling, coasting downhill, rare low revenue/storage opportunity
  - Oscillation period: 40-60s (slow, lazy drift)
- **Low Demand**: Range 0.45x - 0.75x (avg ~0.6x) - Light load, slow operation, reduced payment
  - Oscillation period: 30-40s (relaxed variation)
- **Medium Demand**: Range 0.75x - 1.35x (avg ~1.05x) - Steady operation on flat terrain, baseline payment
  - Oscillation period: 25-30s (standard rhythm)
- **High Demand**: Range 1.35x - 2.65x (avg ~2.0x) - Climbing grade, accelerating, bonus revenue opportunity
  - Oscillation period: 15-25s (urgent fluctuation)
- **Critical Demand**: Range 2.65x - 3.75x (avg ~3.2x) - Steep hill, emergency conditions, maximum revenue/stress event
  - Oscillation period: 10-20s (frantic, emergency pace)

**Note:** Multipliers smoothly interpolate within each state's range using sine wave oscillation with state-dependent periods. When state changes, multiplier starts at a random point within the new state's range for unpredictable transitions.

**Properties:**
- Type: Float, represents steam demand rate in lb/h (pounds per hour)
- Base demand: Starting around 10-15 lb/h at medium state
- Demand scales with train progression and upgrades
- Transition: Changes every 1-5 minutes (triangular distribution, avg ~2.5 min)
- Payment: Steam production × demand multiplier → Gold coins

**Demand Fluctuation Logic:**
```gdscript
# Range definitions for each demand state

    var normalized = (sin(interpolation_time) + 1.0) / 2.0
    demand_multiplier = lerp(target_range_min, target_range_max, normalized)

```

### 4. Steam Storage System ⭐ (PURCHASABLE UPGRADE - Not Available Initially)

**UI Elements:**

**Storage Gauge (Left Panel):**
```
Storage: 450 / 1200
[■■■■■■□□□□]
```

**Storage Control Buttons (Tier 3+):**
- "Release 10%" - Releases 10% of max storage capacity per click (consistent amount regardless of current storage)
- "Auto-Release: ON/OFF" - Toggle automatic release during high demand
- Threshold slider (when auto-release enabled)

**Strategic Gameplay:**

**Active Diversion Strategy (New!):**
1. Player notices "Very Low Demand" state (0.2x multiplier) - trains coasting downhill
2. Current payment: 0.5 coins/sec (low revenue during low demand)
3. Player opens Storage Controls, sets diversion slider to 40%
4. Steam production: 25/sec → Main gets 15/sec, Storage gets 10/sec (before efficiency loss)
5. Storage builds: 200 → 400 → 600 steam over 3 minutes
6. Demand shifts to "High" (1.5x) - trains climbing steep grade
7. Payment jumps to higher value rate
8. Player sets diversion back to 0%, clicks "Release 10%" three times
9. Storage floods main reservoir with 360 steam (3 × 120)
10. Player exceeds high demand, earns maximum revenue for 2 minutes
11. Strategic profit: Stored cheap steam, sold it at premium rates!

**Overflow Capture (Passive Strategy):**
1. Zero demand state triggers (train stopped)
2. Workers continue producing steam
3. Main reservoir fills to 500/500
4. Overflow automatically diverts to storage (with 80% efficiency)
5. Storage fills to 800/1200
6. Player sees: "Excess steam stored for later use"
7. Critical demand spike occurs!
8. Player manually releases storage or auto-release triggers
9. Stored steam floods into main reservoir
10. Player maintains "Excellent" performance during spike
11. Earns bonus revenue for exceeding critical demand

### 5. Train Speed & Payment

**Purpose:** Convert steam production into Gold currency

**Payment Calculation (Direct Steam-to-Gold Conversion):**
```gdscript
# Payment Rate Constant
const PAYMENT_RATE_CONSTANT = 0.01  # Tune for desired earning speed
# Example: 10 lb/h × 1.0 multiplier × 0.01 = 0.1 gold/hour = 6 gold/hour

# Demand Multiplier Ranges (affects payment rate)
# Each state has a min/max range. Actual multiplier interpolates smoothly via sine wave.
# See DEMAND_RANGES constant in Demand Fluctuation Logic section for full definitions.
var demand_ranges = {
    "very_low": {"min": 0.0, "max": 0.45},   # Avg ~0.225x
    "low": {"min": 0.45, "max": 0.75},       # Avg ~0.6x
    "medium": {"min": 0.75, "max": 1.35},    # Avg ~1.05x
    "high": {"min": 1.35, "max": 2.65},      # Avg ~2.0x
    "critical": {"min": 2.65, "max": 3.75}   # Avg ~3.2x
}

# Current demand multiplier (interpolated value within current state's range)
var demand_multiplier: float = 1.05  # Starts at medium midpoint

# Gold accumulation (fractional)
var gold_progress: float = 0.0

# In _process(delta)
var steam_lbs_this_tick = steam_production_rate_lbh * (delta / 3600.0)
var gold_earned = steam_lbs_this_tick * demand_multiplier * PAYMENT_RATE_CONSTANT
gold_progress += gold_earned

# Award whole gold coins
if gold_progress >= 1.0:
    var whole_gold = floor(gold_progress)
    Level1Vars.current_gold += whole_gold
    gold_progress -= whole_gold

# Calculate earning rate for display (gold per minute)
var gold_per_minute = (steam_production_rate_lbh * demand_multiplier * PAYMENT_RATE_CONSTANT) / 60.0
var minutes_per_gold = 1.0 / gold_per_minute if gold_per_minute > 0 else 0
```

**Payment Display (Option 2):**
- Progress bar showing fractional gold accumulated (0.0 - 1.0)
- Visual progress: `[=====>--------------] 0.25 Gold`
- See detailed mockups in approved plan

**Payment Timing:**
- Continuous accrual while in owned_furnace scene
- Pays in **Gold** coins
- Display updates in real-time
