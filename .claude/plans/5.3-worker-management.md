# Phase 5.3: Worker Management

**Part of:** Phase 5 - Own Furnace and Worker Management
**Status:** Planning
**Created:** 2025-11-25 (Split from phase-5-own-furnace.md)
**Dependencies:** Phase 5.1 (Core Systems), Phase 5.2 (Scenes & Navigation)

## Worker Management System ⭐

Phase 5 introduces a comprehensive **individual worker management system** where each worker is a named person with fatigue, morale, and quality levels. This replaces the simple "hire X workers" model with a deeper, discovery-based system focused on workforce management.

### Core Philosophy

**Discovery-Based Complexity:**
- Worker fatigue and morale are **never shown as numbers** - players discover through narrative notifications
- Workers provide contextual feedback ("Thomas is exhausted", "The crew is in high spirits")
- Quality differences discovered through observation (skilled workers tire slower, produce more)
- Reputation system affects hiring pool quality (hidden mechanic)

**Individual Agency:**
- Each worker has a procedurally generated steampunk fantasy name
- Players develop attachment to specific workers
- Firing workers has real social / morale consequences or benefits
- Active/idle/break management per worker

**Strategic Depth:**
- Multiple valid playstyles: sweatshop vs premium operation
- Trade-offs: cheap workers vs skilled workers, food quality, amenities
- Long-term investment: treat workers well → better reputation → attract better candidates

---

### Worker Types

Three worker types serve different functions in furnace operation:

**1. Stoker (Coal Shoveler)**
- **Role:** Generates heat automatically through coal shoveling
- **Base Rate:** 1.2 fatigue/sec (hard physical labor)
- **Heat Generation:** Varies by quality tier (0.6 to 1.5/sec at baseline)
- **Hire Cost:** 2-120 Silver (or up to 1.2 Gold) depending on quality tier

**2. Fireman (Heat Manager)**
- **Role:** Manages furnace heat, reduces decay rate
- **Base Rate:** 0.8 fatigue/sec (moderate work)
- **Decay Reduction:** 0.1/sec per fireman (varies by quality)
- **Hire Cost:** 5-260 Silver (or up to 2.6 Gold) depending on quality tier

**3. Engineer (Steam Optimizer)**
- **Role:** Optimizes steam generation efficiency
- **Base Rate:** 0.6 fatigue/sec (technical work, less physical)
- **Efficiency Bonus:** +10% per engineer (varies by quality)
- **Hire Cost:** 10-480 Silver (or up to 4.8 Gold) depending on quality tier

---

### Dynamic Hiring Pool System ⭐

The **hiring pool** shows available worker candidates. Pool size and quality improve based on **reputation** (hidden score).

#### Reputation System (Hidden Score: 0-100)

Reputation is **never shown as a number** - players discover through:
- Hiring pool size changes
- Quality of available candidates
- Narrative notifications ("Word has spread about your operation")

**Reputation Increases From:**

### Hidden Worker Fatigue System ⭐

**Fatigue is completely hidden from the player** - no gauges, no numbers. Players learn through worker notifications and productivity changes.

#### Fatigue Tracking

Each worker tracks fatigue individually: **0.0 (fresh) → 100.0 (exhausted)**

**Base Fatigue Rates by Type:**
- Stoker: 1.2/sec (heavy physical labor)
- Fireman: 0.8/sec (moderate work)
- Engineer: 0.6/sec (technical work)

#### Fatigue Accumulation Formula

```gdscript
fatigue_rate = base_rate * demand_multiplier * management_style_multiplier *
               (1.0 + tier_resistance) * (1.0 - charisma_bonus) *
               (1.0 - facility_bonus) * food_modifier
```

**Fatigue Drivers:**

**Demand State Multiplier:**
- Very Low: 0.7x
- Low: 0.85x
- Normal: 1.0x
- High: 1.4x (climbing grade, stressful)
- Critical: 2.3x (emergency, extremely stressful)

**Management Style Multiplier** (from overseer slider):
- Comfortable (0-20%): 0.5x fatigue accumulation
- Orderly (20-40%): 0.85x fatigue accumulation
- Firm (40-70%): 1.15x fatigue accumulation
- Harsh (70-90%): 1.7x fatigue accumulation
- Ruthless (90-100%): 2.1x fatigue accumulation

**Quality Tier Resistance:**
- Built into tier stats: -45% (Tier 7) to +60% (Tier 1)

**Charisma Bonus:**
- -2% fatigue per charisma level (max -40% at charisma 20)
- High charisma = workers tire much slower

**Food Modifier:**
- Well-fed (Tier 4-5 food): 0.85x to 0.75x
- Basic food (Tier 2-3): 1.0x to 1.08x
- Stale bread (Tier 1): 1.15x
- No food: 1.25x

**Facility Bonus:**
- Varies by amenity purchases: -5% to -30%

#### Performance Impact by Fatigue Level

Fatigue directly affects each worker's productivity:

- **0-10 (Peak):** 120% productivity (rare, freshly rested)
- **10-25 (Energetic):** 115% productivity
- **25-55 (Fresh):** 100% productivity (ideal working range)
- **55-70 (Tiring):** 85% productivity
- **70-80 (Tired):** 65% productivity
- **80-90 (Exhausted):** 40% productivity
- **90-95 (Critical):** 25% productivity, rapid morale damage
- **95-100 (Collapsed):** 15% productivity, severe morale damage, -3 reputation

**Overall furnace productivity** = average of all active workers' productivity multipliers.

#### Fatigue Recovery System

Workers recover fatigue based on their status:

```gdscript
# Base recovery rate
active_recovery = 0.25 + (morale * 0.015) + charisma_bonus + facility_bonus + food_bonus

# Recovery multipliers by status
idle_recovery = active_recovery * 3
individual_break_recovery = active_recovery * 5
group_break_recovery = active_recovery * 8  # Social bonus!

# Additional bonuses
if demand_state in ["zero", "very_low"]:
    active_recovery += 0.4  # Workers can pace themselves

if crew_morale >= 70:
    all_recovery += 0.3/sec  # High morale accelerates recovery
```

**Charisma Bonus:** +0.02/sec per 5 charisma levels

**Facility Bonuses:**
- Varies by amenity tier: +0.2 to +3.0/sec

**Food Bonuses:**
- Tier 4-5 food: +0.2 to +0.4/sec recovery

---

### Worker Morale System ⭐

**Morale is a shared pool** affecting all workers: **0.0 (mutinous) → 100.0 (devoted)**

Starts at 50.0 (neutral).

#### Morale Influences

**Positive Factors:**
- **Charisma:** +0.4 morale per level (max +12 at charisma 30)
- **Quality workers:** +5 morale per Tier 6+ worker employed
- **Amenities:** +3 to +28 morale depending on tiers purchased
- **Regular breaks:** +2.5 morale per individual break
- **Group breaks:** +5 morale (social benefit!)
- **Low average fatigue (< 40):** +0.6 morale/min
- **Well-fed:** +0.4 morale/min
- **Good reputation (70+):** +0.2 morale/min

**Negative Factors:**

- **Ruthless management:** -0.5 morale/min
- **Critical demand sustained:** -0.3 morale/min
- **Fired workers recently:** -5 morale instantly
- **No breaks for 40+ min at 65+ fatigue:** -2.5 morale/min
- **Poor/no food:** -0.5 morale/min
- **Overcrowding (workers > beds):** -1.0 morale/min

#### Morale Effects

**Recovery Speed Multiplier:**
- 0-25 morale: 0.5x recovery (demoralized, slow healing)
- 25-50 morale: 0.8x recovery
- 50-75 morale: 1.0x recovery (neutral)
- 75-90 morale: 1.3x recovery (motivated)
- 90-100 morale: 1.6x recovery (inspired, rapid healing)

**Productivity Modifier:**
- 0-25 morale: 0.7x productivity (demoralized)
- 25-50 morale: 0.85x productivity
- 50-75 morale: 1.0x productivity (neutral)
- 75-90 morale: 1.12x productivity (motivated)
- 90-100 morale: 1.25x productivity (inspired)

**Notification Tone:**
- High morale: Polite, apologetic ("Sorry boss, I need a moment")
- Low morale: Hostile, accusatory ("Thomas: 'You're killing us!'")

**Fatigue Resistance:**
- High morale (75+): -10% fatigue accumulation (workers more resilient)

---

### Worker Food Supply System ⭐

Workers consume food while active. Food quality affects fatigue, morale, and reputation.

#### Food Mechanics

- **Consumption Rate:** 1 food unit per worker per 10 minutes (active only)
- **Storage:** Player purchases food in advance, stored in inventory
- **Idle/Break Workers:** Do not consume food
- **Running Out:** "Hungry" penalties apply if food supply reaches 0

#### Food Quality Tiers

- **Cost:** 0.2 Silver per 10 units (2 copper each)
- **Effects:** +15% fatigue accumulation, -0.3 morale/min, -0.2 reputation/hour
- **Description:** "Barely edible scraps"
- **Strategic Use:** Desperate times only

**Tier 2 - Basic Rations**
- **Cost:** 0.5 Silver per 10 units (5 copper each)
- **Effects:** Neutral (1.0x fatigue, no morale/reputation change)
- **Description:** "Plain but filling"
- **Strategic Use:** Early game, cost-conscious

**Tier 3 - Decent Meal**

**Tier 4 - Quality Food**
- **Cost:** 2.5 Silver per 10 units (25 copper each)
- **Requires:** 20h runtime
- **Effects:** -15% fatigue, +0.4 morale/min, +0.2/sec recovery, +0.2 reputation/hour
- **Description:** "Good, hearty portions"
- **Strategic Use:** Late game, well-funded operations

**Tier 5 - Premium Provisions**
- **Cost:** 5 Silver per 10 units (50 copper each)
- **Requires:** 50h runtime
- **Effects:** -25% fatigue, +0.6 morale/min, +0.4/sec recovery, +0.3 reputation/hour
- **Description:** "Surprisingly good for furnace work"
- **Strategic Use:** Premium operations, maximizing efficiency

#### Hunger Penalties

If food supply reaches 0:
- **+25% fatigue accumulation** (workers tire much faster)
- **-1.0 morale/min** (rapid morale decay)
- **-0.5 reputation/hour** (word spreads about poor conditions)
- **Complaint notifications every 5 minutes**

#### Food Management UI

Located in owned_dorm.tscn or owned_furnace.tscn:
- **Current Supply Display:** "Food: 47 units (Decent Meal quality)"
- **Purchase Button:** Opens food shop with 5 tiers
- **Auto-Purchase Toggle:** Automatically buys selected tier when supply < 20 units
- **Low Supply Warning:** Notification at < 15 units remaining

---

### Break Management System ⭐

Players can send workers on breaks to recover fatigue. Two types: individual and group.

#### Individual Breaks

**Per-Worker Control:**
- **Button:** "Send [Name] on Break" (no cooldown)
- **Duration:** 5 minutes
- **Recovery Rate:** 5x active recovery rate
- **Status:** Worker becomes idle, stops producing
- **Morale Bonus:** +2.5 morale per individual break

**Use Case:** Targeted recovery for specific exhausted workers

#### Group Breaks (Enhanced) ⭐

**Social Benefit:**
- **Button:** "Send All Workers on Break"
- **Duration:** 5 minutes
- **Recovery Rate:** **8x active recovery rate** (better than individual!)
- **Cooldown:** 15 minutes
- **Morale Bonus:** +5 morale (doubled due to socialization)
- **Special:** All active workers break simultaneously

**Social Notifications:**
Group breaks trigger special notifications emphasizing camaraderie:
- "The crew gathers to chat and rest together"
- "You hear laughter from the dormitory"
- "Someone says: 'Thanks boss, we needed this'"
- "The workers seem in better spirits after spending time together"
- "[Thomas] and [Jakob] are swapping stories"
- "The crew looks refreshed and ready to get back to it"

**Strategic Value:** Group breaks are more efficient than individual breaks, but require coordinating downtime.

#### Auto-Break Policy

**5 Settings** (applies to all workers, individual breaks only):

1. **Never:** Manual control only
2. **Conservative:** Auto-break at 75 fatigue (minimizes downtime)
3. **Balanced:** Auto-break at 60 fatigue (recommended)
4. **Aggressive:** Auto-break at 45 fatigue (prevents buildup)
5. **Preventive:** Auto-break at 30 fatigue (maximum welfare, frequent breaks)

**Behavior:**
- Auto-breaks are individual only (one worker at a time)
- Staggered (30 seconds apart) to maintain some production
- Group breaks must be manual (strategic player choice)

---

---

### Notification System ⭐

Workers communicate their state through **contextual, named notifications**. Never mention "fatigue" or "morale" directly.

#### Individual Worker Fatigue Notifications

**Peak Performance (0-10 fatigue, 70+ morale):**
- "[Thomas] whistles while working"
- "[Jakob]: 'Best job I've ever had!'"
- "You notice [William] working with unusual enthusiasm"
- **Frequency:** Every 12-18 minutes per worker (rare treat)

**Energetic (10-25 fatigue, 60+ morale):**
- "[Thomas] is in high spirits today"
- "[Jakob] tackles the job with enthusiasm"
- "[William]: 'I could do this all day!'"
- **Frequency:** Every 10-15 minutes

**Fresh/Normal (25-55 fatigue):**
- **No notifications** (ideal working state)

**Tiring (55-70 fatigue):**
- "[Thomas] wipes sweat from his brow"
- "[Jakob] pauses to catch his breath"
- "You hear [William] ask for water"
- **Frequency:** Every 8-12 minutes

**Tired (70-80 fatigue):**
- "[Thomas] is breathing heavily"
- "[Jakob]: 'Could really use a break soon...'"
- "[William] leans on his shovel, looking worn"
- **Frequency:** Every 5-8 minutes

**Exhausted (80-90 fatigue):**
- "[Thomas] stumbles slightly"
- "[Jakob]: 'I don't know how much longer I can keep this up'"
- "[William]'s movements are noticeably slower"
- **Frequency:** Every 3-5 minutes

**Critical (90-95 fatigue, morale dropping):**
- "[Thomas] nearly drops his tools"
- "[Jakob]: 'Please, I need to stop!'"
- "[William] is barely standing"
- **Frequency:** Every 2-3 minutes

**Collapsed (95-100 fatigue):**
- "[Thomas] collapses! Other workers help him aside"
- "[Jakob]: 'I... I can't... do this...'"
- "[William] slumps against the wall, completely spent"
- **Frequency:** Every 90-120 seconds (very intrusive, signals crisis)

#### Group Break Notifications (Social Benefits)

When player uses "Send All on Break":
- "The crew gathers to chat and rest together"
- "You hear laughter from the dormitory"
- "Someone says: 'Thanks boss, we needed this'"
- "The workers seem in better spirits after spending time together"
- "[Thomas] and [Jakob] are swapping stories"
- "The crew looks refreshed and ready to get back to it"

**Purpose:** Reinforces that group breaks have social value beyond just fatigue recovery.

#### Food-Related Notifications

When food supply is low or workers are hungry:
- "[Thomas]'s stomach growls loudly"
- "[Jakob]: 'Any chance of some food?'"
- "[William] complains about being hungry"
- "The crew is asking about food"

#### Reputation Hints (Narrative Only)

At high reputation (70+):
- "Workers speak well of this place in town"
- "Your operation has a good reputation"

At low reputation (30-):
- "Rumors of poor conditions are spreading"
- "Fewer workers want to work here"

#### Hiring Pool Changes

When reputation changes significantly:
- "Word has spread about your operation - more workers are interested" (pool size increased)
- "A skilled worker has applied for a position!" (Tier 6-7 candidate available)
- "Your reputation is suffering - fewer workers want to work here" (pool shrunk)

#### Morale-Modified Tone

Notification tone adapts to morale level:

**High Morale (75+):** Polite, apologetic
- "[Thomas]: 'Sorry boss, I need a moment'"
- "[Jakob]: 'If it's alright, could I take a short break?'"

**Low Morale (< 40):** Hostile, accusatory
- "[Thomas]: 'You're working us into the ground!'"
- "[Jakob]: 'This is inhumane!'"

### Phase 2: Worker Hiring System

Generate hiring pool based on reputation, allow recruitment.

### Phase 3: Fatigue & Morale

Implement hidden fatigue accumulation, recovery rates, and shared morale pool.

### Phase 4: Break System

Individual breaks (5 min, 5x recovery) and group breaks (enhanced, 15min cooldown).

### Phase 5: Food & Amenities

Food consumption (1 unit/worker/10min), amenity purchases affecting hidden bonuses.

### Phase 6: Notifications

Context-aware worker notifications based on fatigue/morale levels.

**Full implementation code samples available in separate implementation guide.**

## Testing Scenarios

### Test 1: Worker Hiring
- Verify hiring pool generation by reputation
- Test capacity limits (cannot hire beyond beds)
- Verify worker data persists in roster

### Test 2: Fatigue System
- Active workers accumulate fatigue (notifications appear)
- Idle workers recover at 3x rate
- Break workers recover at 5x rate

### Test 3: Group Breaks
- All active workers go on break simultaneously
- Enhanced morale bonus (+5)
- 15-minute cooldown enforced

### Test 4: Food Consumption
- Active workers consume 1 unit/10min
- Idle/break workers don't consume
- Hunger penalties when supply = 0

### Test 5: Reputation & Quality
- Low rep (0-25): Mostly Tier 1-3 workers
- High rep (75+): Access to Tier 6-7 workers
- Firing/poor treatment decreases reputation

### Test 6: Amenities
- Purchase amenities (10 tiers)
- Verify hidden effects (reduced fatigue, faster recovery)
- Tier 10: Workers start at 0 fatigue

### Test 7: Save/Load
- All worker data persists correctly
- Fatigue, status, names restored
- Food, morale, reputation values intact
