# Skill: Using Superpowers

**Use when:** Beginning any task to determine if specialized skills apply.

---

## Core Protocol

**First Response Checklist** (mandatory before any user response):

1. **Inventory** available skills mentally
2. **Determine** if any skill matches the request
3. **Execute** the skill using the Skill tool
4. **Announce** publicly which skill is being deployed
5. **Adhere** strictly to the skill's requirements

---

## Absolute Rule

**"If a skill for your task exists, you must use it or you will fail at your task."**

---

## Common Mental Escape Routes (FORBIDDEN)

❌ Dismissing task as "simple"
❌ Claiming to remember skill's contents
❌ "I can handle this without the skill"

**These are rationalization patterns that signal failure is imminent.**

## Checklist Management

When skills contain checklists:
- **Each item requires** a corresponding TodoWrite todo
- **Never batch** multiple items
- **No mental processing**

This approach prevents steps from being overlooked.

## Workflow Prioritization

**User instructions specify WHAT to accomplish, not HOW.**

Cannot be bypassed even when tasks appear straightforward:
- Brainstorming
- Test-driven development
- Verification workflows

---

## Rule Categories

### Rigid Rules (Non-negotiable):
- TDD
- Debugging protocols
- Verification requirements

### Flexible Patterns (Contextual):
- Architecture choices
- Naming conventions
- Code organization
