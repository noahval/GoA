## The Process

### 1. Understanding the Idea
- Examine project context
- Ask questions **one at a time** to refine the idea
- Prefer multiple choice over open-ended questions
- Focus on: purpose, constraints, success criteria

### 2. Exploring Approaches
- Propose **2-3 different approaches** with trade-offs
- Present conversationally
- Lead with recommended option and reasoning
- Apply YAGNI principle ruthlessly

### 3. Presenting the Design
- Present in sections of **200-300 words**
- Validate incrementally after each section
- Cover:
  - Architecture
  - Components
  - Data flow
  - Error handling
  - Testing

## After the Design

### Documentation
Save to: `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md`

Commit to version control.

### Implementation
Ask: "Ready to set up for implementation?"

Utilize git worktrees for isolated workspaces and detailed planning.
