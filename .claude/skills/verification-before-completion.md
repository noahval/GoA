# Skill: Verification Before Completion

**Use when:** Before claiming any work is complete, tests pass, or features work.

---

## Core Principle

**Evidence before claims, always.**

**NO COMPLETION CLAIMS WITHOUT FRESH VERIFICATION EVIDENCE**

Skipping verification steps constitutes dishonesty, not efficiency.

---

## The Gate Function

Before making ANY success claim:

1. **Identify** which command proves the assertion
2. **Execute** the complete command freshly
3. **Read** full output and check exit codes
4. **Verify** whether output actually supports the claim
5. **Only then** state the claim with evidence

---

## Critical Red Flags

❌ Uncertain language: "should", "probably", "likely"
❌ Expressing satisfaction before testing
❌ Trusting agent reports without independent verification
❌ "Just this once" or "I'm confident" rationalizations

---

## Forbidden Shortcuts

**Never:**
- Assume tests pass without running them
- Trust previous run results
- Skip verification for "obvious" changes
- Rely on memory of what code does

---

## Real-World Stakes

False completion claims cause:
- Broken trust
- Shipped undefined functions
- Incomplete features
- Wasted time debugging "working" code

---

## Bottom Line

**Run verification commands. Read actual output. Then report results.**

**No exceptions.**
