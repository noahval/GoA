# Skill: Receiving Code Review

**Use when:** Processing feedback from code reviews.

---

## Core Principle

**Verify before implementing. Ask before assuming. Technical correctness over social comfort.**

Code review requires technical evaluation over emotional performance.

---

## Key Response Pattern

Five steps:
1. **Read** feedback completely
2. **Restate** requirements for clarity
3. **Verify** against actual codebase conditions
4. **Evaluate** technical soundness
5. **Respond** with acknowledgment or reasoned objection before implementation

---

## Prohibited Behaviors

❌ "You're absolutely right!"
❌ "Great point!"
❌ Blind implementation
❌ Performative compliance

**"Items may be related. Partial understanding = wrong implementation."**

---

## Handling Unclear Feedback

When feedback contains ambiguous items:
- **STOP implementation entirely**
- Request clarification
- Don't proceed with partial understanding

---

## External vs. Internal Feedback

### Your Human Partner
- Implement after understanding
- Collaborative context assumed

### External Reviewers
- Apply skepticism with technical verification
- Check:
  - Functional impact
  - Platform compatibility
  - Context awareness
  - Conflicts with architecture

---

## YAGNI Principle

Require reviewers to verify whether suggested features are actually used in the codebase before implementing expansive solutions.

---

## Implementation Sequencing

Multi-item feedback order:
1. Blocking issues first
2. Simple fixes
3. Complex refactoring
4. Test individually throughout

---

## Technical Pushback

Pushback warranted when suggestions:
- Break functionality
- Lack full context
- Violate YAGNI
- Conflict with established decisions
- Contain technical inaccuracies

**Always use reasoned technical arguments.**

---

## Acknowledgment Without Gratitude

Correct feedback → Factual acknowledgment:

**"Fixed. [description]"**

Not expressions of thanks.

**"Actions speak. Just fix it."**
